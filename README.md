# Project 3 Lakers & Clippers Reddit




### Executive Summary
For this project I chose Laker and Clipper data to Webscrape from Reddit. I thought this would be an interesting project to see how both communities engage and to see what they engage about. Free agency is a big time in basketball so it is interesting to see how that affects each community.



### Data Importing
For this I used a webscraper to scrape posts from Reddit. I started with over 4000 posts for both Lakers and Clippers Reddit.



### Data Cleaning
For the cleaning I imputed null values with fill na method and drop duplicate rows. After this I used the Snowball method to clean data from the web.


### Data Modeling
For data modeling I chose the CountVectorizer and Logistic Regression as my best model.


### Recommendations
For this to be successfully on a continual basis we would have to consistently scrape data. These features could change over the course of the NBA season.English stop words were removed but models removing player names could be interesting as well.
